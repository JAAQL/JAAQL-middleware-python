Hi all,  
  
Please do not assume that I have made design decisions from a place of knowledge. If you feel there is something that has been done wrong, a potential security risk etc. please do raise it and I will be more than happy to look at it  
  
Any contributions in the form of fixes will happily be incorporated. Any contributions with regards to improvements will definitely be considered. If they fit within the goals of the project, we will be happy to include + provide credit
